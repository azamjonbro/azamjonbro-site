I specialize in Vue.js, Electron.js, and React.js, building high-performance web and desktop applications with clean, minimal, and efficient code.  Over the years, I’ve developed custom CRMs, IoT-based monitoring systems, and Telegram bot integrations — all tailored for real-world users and cross-platform compatibility. I focus on speed, security, and user-friendly design, avoiding unnecessary libraries to keep things lightweight and reliable."

I enjoy crafting smooth, cross-platform desktop applications with Electron.js, especially when there's a challenge to support everything from Windows 7 to modern macOS.Outside of coding, I'm fascinated by automation, data visualization, and creating internal tools that improve workflows. I also enjoy teaching and mentoring — helping others understand not just how to code, but why things work the way they do. In my free time, I explore JavaScript internals, low-level browser behavior, and new trends in front-end architecture. I believe the best developers are lifelong learners — and I’m always curious to dig deeper."

I’ve continuously expanded my knowledge through real-world projects, advanced online courses, and by mentoring others in the field. While formal education gave me the basics, most of my skills were shaped by building actual applications — from custom CRMs and IoT dashboards to cross-platform Electron apps and Telegram bots. I believe in learning by doing, and my strongest education has come from solving real problems with clean code, smart design, and modern frameworks.",
